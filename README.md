In this report, I studied a sequence which is a model for the evolution of a civilisation. Sequences are extremely useful in science. They can be used to study animal populations, but they are also involved in quantum physics and electronics. In the second part, I used the Monte Carlo algorithm to evaluate integrals. The implementation of the algorithm is extremely easy thanks to numpy smart features (random generations of point and np.where function).
